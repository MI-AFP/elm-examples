# Elm Examples: Web Application

Example of single-page web application based on [elm-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/MI-AFP/elm-webpack-boilerplate) using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com). It demonstrates how to use navigation, how you can split Elm application code into multiple modules, and how to build the application for production.


You need to install server dependencies using npm:

```
$ npm install
```

Then, you can run the server:

```
$ npm run server
```

The Elm application can be run in development mode with hot reload using Webpack:

```
$ npm start
```

If you want to create a production build, use:

```
$ npm run build
```
