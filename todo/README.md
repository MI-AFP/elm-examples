# Elm Examples: TODO list

Example of simple TODO list that uses server to save and load TODOs. It demonstrates how the Elm architecture works and how to use [elm/http](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/http/latest/) and [elm/json](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/) packages.


You need to install server dependencies using npm:

```
$ npm install
```

Then, you can start the server:

```
$ npm run server
```

And the Elm app using elm reactor:

```
$ elm reactor
```
